Description: This package consists of data sets and functions that are useful
    in the teaching of statistics at an elementary level to students who may
    have little or no previous experience with the command line.  The functions
    for elementary inferential procedures follow a uniform interface for user
    input. The package is typically used with package mosaic but runs
    independently of it.  Some of the functions are instructional applets that
    can only be run on the R Studio integrated development environment with
    RStudio's package manipulate loaded. R Studio is freely available
    (www.rstudio.org), and includes package manipulate.
