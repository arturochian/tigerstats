# Preliminaries

We assume that the instructor is familiar with R, and has a basic understanding of the `mosaic` package and its use in the teaching of statistics.  Consult, e.g., the `mosaic` vignette "Start Teaching Statistics Using R."

# Package Requirements

In its current version package `tigerstats` depends on the packages `mosaic`, `mosaicData`and `abd`.  All of these will be attached when one attaches `tigerstats`:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tigerstats)
```

# Workhorse Functions

`tigerstats` is used in an elementayr classroom setting where students are taught to perform a "variable analysis"
